A simple parking management program. You don't need a network connection for this program, as it creates everything locally on files. The program is written in Java.

Login: admin 
Password: admin

Unfortunately, it is not possible to change either the login or the password for the reason that it was made specifically for a person who does not need a network to manage the parking lot. 
I recommend placing the program in a folder, preferably on some disk, and creating a shortcut to the program. 
I also recommend making a backup of files whenever making any changes or additions, whether it's to the cloud, another disk, or even a flash drive. 
Kisses for you <3
